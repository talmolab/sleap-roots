# Circumnutation pipeline — implementation roadmap

This is the umbrella tracking doc for adding circumnutation analysis to sleap-roots. It is the *only* place the full multi-PR program lives. It does not duplicate the theoretical content (in `theory.md`) or the empirical feasibility numbers (in `preliminary_results_2026-05-07.md`); it points to them.

Each numbered PR below has its own OpenSpec change-id and its own GitHub issue. **OpenSpec changes are written just-in-time**, when the corresponding PR is opened — not all up front. **GitHub issues are drafted lazily** to `c:\vaults\sleap-roots\circumnutation\github_issues\` as we approach each PR. The status checkboxes here are the source of truth for what's done, in flight, and queued.

---

## Vision

Tracked SLEAP tip trajectories from `TrackedTipPipeline` enter; per-plant scalar circumnutation traits (period, amplitude, handedness, growth-zone length, balance number, traveling-wave residual) and per-plant time-series CSVs and diagnostic plots come out. Trait list, units, and source citations are fixed by `theory.md` §7. Validation is three-layer: synthetic, Derr-pilot regression, cross-tier consistency.

## Inputs and outputs

- **Input:** per-track tip trajectories `(series, sample_uid, timepoint, track_id, frame, tip_x, tip_y)` plus `px_per_mm` calibration (optional). Today, in this codebase, `track_id` and `plant_id` are 1:1 — a track *is* a plant. The schema reserves both columns so that a future change (e.g., multi-track-per-plant scenarios) is non-breaking.
- **Output:** `traits_per_plant.csv` (one row per `(series, sample_uid, plate_id, plant_id, track_id)`), `traits_per_plant.units.json`, `trajectory_per_plant/<id>.csv`, `plots/*.png`, `run_metadata.json`.

## Architecture (link only — not duplicated here)

Five computation tiers + QC tier, full description in `theory.md` §6.3. Trait list with units and source citations in `theory.md` §7. Empirical feasibility numbers (noise floor, period, amplitude, SNR, DPI ambiguity, Nyquist comfort) in `preliminary_results_2026-05-07.md`.

## Cross-cutting concerns

These apply across many PRs and need to be designed into the foundation rather than retro-fitted.

### CC-1. L_gz mask is applied AFTER detection, not before.

The growth-zone mask (apical region of the tip-trail, length ≈ `L_gz`) is *not* known at midline-reconstruction time. The correct algorithm is:

1. Smooth `(x, y)`; reconstruct full midline with arc-length `s(τ)`; compute `κ(s)` along the *full* trail. **No mask.** (PR #8.)
2. Spatial CWT on the full `κ(s)`; peak-find `L_gz_estimate` from the `|κ(s)|` envelope; fit exponential decay basal of the peak for `L_c_estimate`. (PR #9.)
3. *Now* construct the growth-zone mask using the detected `L_gz`, and apply it to compute downstream traits (`λ_spatial_median`, `traveling_wave_residual`) on the basal-of-peak portion only. (PR #10.)

PR #8's "growth-zone mask" responsibility is removed; PR #10 owns it.

### CC-2. Configuration strategy: module-level named constants.

Match `tracked_tip_pipeline.py` convention: tuple/dict module-level constants (e.g., `_TRACKED_TIP_UNITS`, `_VALID_ROOT_TYPES`, `_SCHEMA_VERSION`). One `_constants.py` per tier OR top-level if shared. Magic numbers to name (non-exhaustive — flesh out in PR #1):

| Constant | Default | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `NOISE_MASK_K` | 2 | `theory.md` §6.2 (κ-mask: \|v\| > 2σ_v) |
| `LGZ_STEADY_STATE_RESIDUAL_MAX` | 0.2 | `theory.md` §7.4 |
| `NYQUIST_RATIO_MAX` | 0.25 | `theory.md` §6.5 |
| `SG_D2_AGREEMENT_MAX` | 1.5 | `theory.md` §7.6 (clean-track threshold) |
| `LGZ_NMIN_RESOLVABLE` | 5 | `theory.md` §6.4 |
| `COI_FRACTION_MAX` | 0.5 | `theory.md` §7.6 |
| `BAND_POWER_NOISE_RATIO` | 3 | `theory.md` §7.6 (`is_nutating` threshold) |
| `WAVELET_DEFAULT_TEMPORAL` | `"cmor1.5-1.0"` | Forensic match to Derr Sept-2025 oracle |
| `WAVELET_DEFAULT_SPATIAL` | `"cgau2"` | Rivière 2022 §"Kinematics: fine elongation measurements" |
| `SG_WINDOW_SHORT` | 5 | `preliminary_results.md` §3.3 |
| `SG_DEGREE` | 3 | `preliminary_results.md` §3.3 |
| `SG_WINDOW_DETREND` | 23 | `preliminary_results.md` §3.4 (≈ 2 nutation periods) |
| `OUTLIER_STEP_RATIO` | 2 | `preliminary_results.md` §4.1 (median multiplier) |

Each constant is overridable via the pipeline class init or per-call kwarg, but defaults flow from one place.

### CC-3. Calibration metadata pattern reuses TrackedTipPipeline's.

`TrackedTipPipeline` already serializes `px_per_mm` somewhere — sidecar JSON, CSV header comment, attrs, or per-row column. **PR #1 has an explicit investigation task: read `tracked_tip_pipeline.py` + the integration test fixtures + the existing trait CSV outputs to determine the exact pattern, then replicate it.** The acceptance criterion is: a downstream user can load `TrackedTipPipeline` output and `CircumnutationPipeline` output with the same loader.

### CC-4. Row identity in trait CSV.

To make per-plate / per-genotype / per-plant aggregation feasible without re-engineering, the per-plant trait CSV row-identity columns are:

```
series, sample_uid, timepoint, plate_id, plant_id, track_id, genotype, treatment
```

Today `plant_id == track_id` everywhere; both columns are populated identically. The schema reserves both so a future divergence (multi-track-per-plant, e.g. measuring a plant via tip + a side-marker) is a non-breaking change. `genotype` and `treatment` are populated from `Series` metadata if available, NaN otherwise. PR #1 task: confirm `TrackedTipPipeline` output exposes `plate_id` and the metadata fields, and document upstream-dependency contract if it doesn't.

### CC-5. Growth-axis edge case (low-displacement plants).

Some real tracks have net displacement comparable to per-frame noise (mutants, stressed plants, very early imaging windows). The growth axis defined as `(x_N - x_1) / |x_N - x_1|` is meaningless in that regime. PR #2 must:

1. Compute net displacement `D = |x_N - x_1|` (in pixels).
2. If `D < GROWTH_AXIS_RELIABILITY_K * sg_residual_xy` (recommend `K = 10`), set `growth_axis_unreliable = True` and set the rotation-dependent traits (`v_long_median`, `v_lat_median`, `long_lat_ratio`, `principal_axis_angle`) to NaN.
3. The QC tier emits `growth_axis_unreliable` as a bool flag.

### CC-6. CWT determinism / reproducibility.

- Synthetic generator (PR #4) accepts an explicit `random_state` (numpy `Generator` or seed `int`) and propagates it.
- `pywavelets.cwt` is deterministic — confirm in PR #5.
- The ridge-extraction algorithm (PR #5) MUST be deterministic — no random tie-breaking, no shuffling. Document in the function docstring.
- Tests assert determinism: same input → identical output across two runs, including in CI on different OSs.

### CC-7. Tier 1 coordinate choice for Derr regression.

Derr's Sept-2025 oracle signal was a 1D coordinate but he didn't document which. Forensic reading (`preliminary_results.md` and the input PDF analysis): the ~80 px non-monotonic drift + ~10 px oscillation matches the **lateral coordinate** (perpendicular to growth axis), not raw image-x or image-y. Resolution:

- **Default:** `coordinate="lateral"` for Tier 1 (uses Tier 0's growth-axis estimate).
- **Configurable:** `coordinate=` accepts `["x", "y", "longitudinal", "lateral"]`.
- **Layer-2 regression test (PR #6):** uses `coordinate="lateral"` and asserts `T = 3333 s ± 2%`. If the assertion fails, log the result for `coordinate="x"`, `"y"` as a diagnostic.
- **Close-out PR #21** (verify-equations) confirms with Julien which coordinate his pilot used and locks in the test target.

### CC-8. `is_nutating` threshold: `noise_floor_estimate` definition.

`is_nutating` is defined in `theory.md` §7.6 as `band_power_ratio > BAND_POWER_NOISE_RATIO * noise_floor_estimate`. Pin the noise-floor definition:

- `noise_floor_estimate` = median of the Tier-1 Fourier amplitude spectrum over frequencies `> 5 × (1 / T_nutation_median)` (out-of-band Fourier floor).
- Rationale: signal-band-relative, no dependence on calibration, matches Derr's plot's empty-spectrum region.

Implementation in PR #6.

### CC-9. Logging convention.

Per-module logger via `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`, matching `tracked_tip_pipeline.py`. Per-plate progress messages at `INFO`; per-plant inside-plate messages at `DEBUG`. PR #1 sets up; subsequent PRs use.

### CC-10. Number of independent noise estimators in QC tier (Phase 1).

Per Elizabeth's directive (this conversation): all three independent noise estimators are emitted in Phase 1 — `sg_residual_xy`, `d2_noise_xy`, `msd_noise_xy`. Pairwise agreement traits: `sg_d2_agreement`, `sg_msd_agreement`, `d2_msd_agreement`. `track_is_clean` requires all three pairwise agreements ≤ 1.5. Implementation in PR #3.

### Beyond Phase 1.5 (out of this roadmap)

- Multi-node SLEAP skeleton tracking upstream → unlocks the spatial profile traits the current tip-only pipeline can't measure (theory.md §6.6).
- Full `(β, γ, θ_p)` identification with gravitropism stimulus.
- tsfresh exploratory feature extraction layer.
- 3D reconstruction.
- AFM / cell-wall biology workstream.
- Live monitoring during timelapse (post-hoc analysis only in Phase 1).
- Multi-plate analysis: re-run on plates 002 (GA₄), 003 (MOCK rep), 004 (TZT) once Phase 1 is stable on plate 001.

## Open scientific blockers (live-tracked)

These are flagged in `theory.md` and `preliminary_results.md`. The pipeline runs around them; resolution moves Phase-1 deliverables from "scale-tentative" to "publication-defensible." Tracked as PRs #19–22 above. None blocks Phase-1 code merging.
