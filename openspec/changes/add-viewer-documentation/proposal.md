## Why

Issue #141 acceptance criteria requires "Documentation added to docs/guides/" for the HTML prediction viewer. The viewer feature is complete but undocumented, making it hard for users to discover and use.

## What Changes

- Add user guide at `docs/guides/prediction-viewer.md`
- Update README.md to mention the viewer command
- Update `docs/guides/index.md` to link to viewer guide

## Impact

- Affected specs: `html-prediction-viewer`
- Affected files:
  - `docs/guides/prediction-viewer.md` (new)
  - `docs/guides/index.md` (add viewer link)
  - `README.md` (add viewer section)
